title: What I do when my mother breaks your powerbank
---


Fallen down, so dies my 10.000 mAh powerbank paid 15 euro on Amazon. But now... I have something to do with.

I got my C.H.I.P 4 days ago, backed on [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1598272670/chip-the-worlds-first-9-computer) and it has a battery pin, a JST-PH 2.0mm pin. I just ordered a news JST pin, i'll take out the wires from the powerpack and utilise the battery on C.H.I.P.. I hope it'll work.

My powerbank has two cell, interconnected parts, 3.7 volts and 5.000 mAh per part:

Falling got broken the USB port, I guess, because nothing seems burned out:

I know that 10.000 mAh is quite a big power for the little C.H.I.P., but...well someway I'll use it. 

*Some update when the JST pin will come home.*
